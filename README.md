OpenSBURB is a fictional project to create a faux codebase for OpenSBURB, an "improved, open-source version of SBURB with lots of new features." 

The codebase is written in C++, and is planned to include the following:
* Most mechanics present in Homestuck
* Extensions to those mechanics ranging from helpful to "annoying and stupid for no reason because screw you"
* A compiler for ~ATH, written in suitably obfuscated C/C++
* Object-oriented code that makes you wonder just how high you even have to be to write shit like this?
* Full Doxygen-based documentation, none of which is intended to make any real sense
* All the fun of working in a team with a bunch of fuckasses who can't actually code
* Worldbuilding, maybe?
